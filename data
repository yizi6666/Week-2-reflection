# Scholarly Migration Dataset (1998–2020)

## Overview

The Scholarly Migration Dataset provides a comprehensive view of international migration patterns of researchers across 210 countries and regions from 1998 to 2020. Leveraging bibliometric data from Elsevier’s Scopus and the open-access OpenAlex database, this dataset offers detailed statistics on yearly migration rates, bilateral flows, and net migration counts for scholars. It includes carefully pre-processed and validated data that highlight global scholarly mobility trends, such as migration corridors and the influence of economic development on academic migration.

Prepared by the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, the dataset supports research in migration studies, demography, and global talent circulation. Aggregated results and analytical tools are shared openly for further analysis and visualization.
